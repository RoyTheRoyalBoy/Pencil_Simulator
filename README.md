# Pencil_Simulator
Hello,
This is my submission for the Pencil Durability Kata. During the development process, I've been notified that the program does not need a "front end" or interactivity, so please disregard the main file. 

To run, simply navigate to the root directory and run the following commands: "make test" and "./test". 

Please refer to image below for further guidance:

Thank you again for this opportunity as well as for your time and consideration. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact me. 

Sincerely, 
Roy
