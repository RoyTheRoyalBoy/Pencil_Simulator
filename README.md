# Pencil_Simulator
Hello,
This is my submission for the Pencil Durability Kata. During the development process, I've been notified that the program does not need a "front end" or interactivity, so please disregard the main file. 

To run, simply navigate to the root directory and run the following commands: "make test" and "./test". 
See image below for further guidance:
